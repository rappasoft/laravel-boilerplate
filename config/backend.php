	/**
	 * Layout for the Admin LTE backend theme
	 *
	 * Fixed:               use the class .fixed to get a fixed header and sidebar.
	 *                      This makes scrolling affect the content only and put the sidebar and header in a fixed position.
	 *
	 * Collapsed Sidebar:   use the class .sidebar-collapse to have a collapsed sidebar upon loading.
	 *                      Use this if you want the sidebar to be hidden by default.
	 *
	 * Boxed Layout:        use the class .layout-boxed to get a boxed layout that stretches only to 1250px.
	 *                      Provides spaces on both sides of the screen, if the screen is big enough.
	 *
	 * Top Navigation:      use the class .layout-top-nav to remove the sidebar and have your links at the top navbar.
	 *                      Makes the sidebar hover the content when expanded.
	 *
	 * Sidebar Mini:        Shows the only the icons of the sidebar items when collapsed. Sidebar will not fully collapse.
	 *
	 * Available options:
	 *
	 * fixed
	 * sidebar-collapse
	 * layout-boxed
	 * layout-top-nav
	 * sidebar-mini
	 *
	 * Note: you cannot use both layout-boxed and fixed at the same time. Anything else can be mixed together.
