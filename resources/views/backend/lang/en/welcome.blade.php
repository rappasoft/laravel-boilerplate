<p>This is the AdminLTE theme by <a href="https://almsaeedstudio.com/" target="_blank">https://almsaeedstudio.com/</a>. This is a stripped down version with only the necessary styles and scripts to get it running. Download the full version to start adding components to your dashboard.</p>
<p>All the functionality is for show with the exception of the <strong>User Management</strong> to the left. This boilerplate comes with a fully functional access control library to manage users/roles/permissions.</p>
<p>Keep in mind it is a work in progress and their may be bugs or other issues I have not come across. I will do my best to fix them as I receive them.</p>
<p>Hope you enjoy all of the work I have put into this. Please visit the <a href="https://github.com/rappasoft/laravel-5-boilerplate" target="_blank">GitHub</a> page for more information and report any <a href="https://github.com/rappasoft/Laravel-5-Boilerplate/issues" target="_blank">issues here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>This project is very demanding to keep up with given the rate at which the master Laravel branch changes, so any help is appreciated.</strong></p>
