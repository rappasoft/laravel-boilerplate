This section is where you specify that this permission depends on the user having one or more other permissions.<br/><br/>
    For example: This permission may be <strong>create-user</strong>, but if the user doesn't also have <strong>view-backend</strong> and <strong>view-access-management</strong> permissions they will never be able to get to the <strong>Create User</strong> screen.
